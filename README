This is an plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server.
It packages the scala library needed to run plugins written in scala.

It's based on my Groovy Example, thus I am still using Gradle to build the project. 

Now you don't have to add the scala-library.jar to your classpath.
Your plugins just need to depend on this plugin.
