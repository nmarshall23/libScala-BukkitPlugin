This is an plugin for the Bukkit Minecraft server.
I wanted to see how hard it would be to use Scala to write plugins.

Tested on the current Recommeded Build, that is, 1.2.4-R1.0

It's based on my Groovy Example, thus I am still using Gradle to build the project. 

To run this plugin you must start Craftbukkit with:
 java -Xincgc -Xmx1G -cp "scala-library.jar:craftbukkit.jar" org.bukkit.craftbukkit.Main
